# MIDDLEWARE:

Middleware functions in web development act as a bridge between the incoming request and the application's response. They have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

## Ordering of Middleware:

The order in which middleware functions are defined matters. Middleware defined earlier will be executed first. The next() function is crucial as it passes control to the next middleware in the stack

## Usage:

In many web frameworks, middleware functions are used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more. They can be applied globally to all routes or to specific routes as needed.

## Conclusion:

Middleware plays a crucial role in web development by providing a flexible and modular way to handle various aspects of the request-response cycle. Understanding the types of middleware and how to use them effectively contributes to building scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich web applications.
