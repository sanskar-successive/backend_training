## Monolithic Architecture:
The entire web application is built as a single, tightly integrated unit. All components, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, are tightly coupled.
**Pros**: Simplicity in development and deployment, as everything is in one place.
**Cons**: Scalability can be challenging, as the entire application needs to be scaled together.

## Client-Server Architecture:
Application is split into two main parts: the client (user interface) and the server (business logic and data storage). The client and server communicate over a network.
**Pros**: Improved scalability and easier maintenance compared to monolithic architecture. Allows for more flexible development and updates.
**Cons**: Requires careful management of the client-server communication.

## Microservices Architecture:
Application is broken down into small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service is focused on a specific business capability.
**Pros**: Improved scalability, easier maintenance and updates for individual services, and flexibility in technology choices for each service.
**Cons**: Increased complexity in managing and coordinating the interactions between services.

## Serverless Architecture:
Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers; it means developers don't need to worry about server management. Code is executed in stateless functions, triggered by events (e.g., HTTP requests).
**Pros**: No need to manage servers, automatic scaling, and pay-as-you-go pricing based on actual usage.
**Cons**: Limited control over the underlying infrastructure.
